# JS-CMS - The Javascript CMS, WITH THEMES!
I dont really know HTML/CSS that well, nevermind JS (javascript)...
- Python is more my speed... But I was able to cobble this Frankenstien, <b>OF OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK!</b>, together.
## Why?
Well... Have you ever had a host that didnt support PHP/databases (A POPULAR & TARGET example would be Neocities)?

Where you couldnt run Wonder CMS, let alone Grav CMS... forget about WordPress CMS?
- Its easy: ONE TINY "script.js" edit in notepad per post (so its "codeless") & CSS linking is "hand held".
- its cheaper (ITS FREE!), easier & more accessable than Node.js based CMS's.
- For beginners: This beats "free-hand" HTML/CSS, for ease of entry & speed, at least.
- Publii CMS is over all more cmplicated (Desktop install, files may need "reordering", depending on target web host).
- Netlify CMS  has a complex setup (Git/Bitbucket Backend'ed...for beginners its abit much).
