# JS-CMS - The Low-Fi, Client-Side, Javascript CMS, With CSS Themes!
I dont really know HTML/CSS that well, nevermind JS (javascript)...I blame "mordern" CMS's! Markdown & Python are more my speed. 
- But I was able to cobble this Frankenstien, <b>OF OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK!</b>, together.
- Made with two (2) ".js" files, "imp.js" (The, single page, "Client-side" CMS) & "script.js" (The "Blogging Engine", powering on menus/etc.).
- Only "script.js" needs to "live" online ("Server-side", by uploaded with site's files, to host). Remember: As above, its powers Menus/Etc.
- "Theme" support via custom CSS linking per page (or as default via style.css). There are just under 15 "themes", currently.

### Plans
- Add code to "imp.js", so it automatically updates the "post array" of the "script.js" file,... <b><u>IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?</u></b>
- Change "View CSS location" so its a "drop down", that populates from styles folder, with option for manual text entry of location
- Password protect imp.js with [JavaScript Kit Encrypted Password Generator](http://javascriptkit.com/epassword/index.htm). Note: Will still be s "Client-side" CMS

# Why Do this?
Well, Have you ever had a host that didnt support PHP/databases <b>(A POPULAR & TARGET example would be Neocities)</b>?

Where you couldnt run Wonder CMS, let alone Grav CMS... forget about WordPress CMS?
- Its easy: ONE TINY "script.js" edit in notepad per post (so its "codeless") & CSS linking is "hand held".
- Its cheaper (ITS FREE!), easier & more accessable than Node.js based CMS's.
- For beginners: This beats "free-hand" HTML/CSS, for ease of entry & speed, at least.

This is also a better learning tool than a "fiddle" as it produces IRL results, on Neocities/Etc.

## What About Other "Common" Options?
There are a few, but for the target users, <b>HTML/CSS learners looking to upload to Neocities</b>, they arnt as attractive or useful, IMHO.
- Publii CMS is over all more cmplicated (Desktop install, files may need "reordering", depending on target web host).
- Netlify CMS  has a complex setup (Git/Bitbucket Backend'ed...for beginners its abit much).

# **Getting Started With Zonelets & IMP** ... OR:

# **Getting Started With IMP!**

**How it works**

When you load IMP! Locally, it opens up an editor, where you can enter or import your text, setup SEO tags and custom CSS. When the very same page is served over http, user gets a light, **static** HTML. Page does not require Java Script to be viewed, it's just plain HTML.

<i>Caption: Behold the wonder that is... IMP!</i>

**System requirements**

Descent browser, Firefox or Chrome preferred (tested). If you've updated your browser within last 4 years, it should be fine.

**Step by step guide**

1. Download and unpack. There are 3 files: index.html, style.css and imp.js

2. Open the index.html in your browser (Firefox or Chrome is recommended)

3. Edit it, import or enter your text, preview it. Click the big "Export HTML" ("Save" in newer version) button and save file to the same directory. If you didn't change file name, overwrite old file.

4. Upload files to server, you may skip imp.js, as it's not required for *viewing* file.

5. That's it.

**Known problems**

-   If you use NoScript extension, you'd need to disable it for IMP! page (*not* just set to TRUSTED mode, but disable all restrictions completely)

### **Downloading the Zonelets files**

**Downloading the Zonelets files**

[Click here to download the files from itch.io](https://zonelets.itch.io/zonelets)

### **Uploading the files to Neocities**

**Uploading the files to Neocities**

![](https://zonelets.net/images/tut_neocitiesregister.PNG)

*Caption: Neocities simple sign-up page*

1.  Create an account at [Neocities](https://neocities.org/). Tag your site "zonelets" among other things, if you'd like! (Don't worry: tags can be changed later from your Neocities profile).
2.  Once your account is up and running, delete the existing Neocities starter files (aside from index.html, which cannot be deleted. "index.html" is the default home page file name for websites in general.)

![](https://zonelets.net/images/tut_emptysite.PNG)

*Caption: Neocities site editor with everything deleted except index.html*

1.  Unzip the Zonelets files that you loaded from itch.io and open the folder.
2.  Navigate to ["Edit Site"](https://neocities.org/dashboard), and upload all the Zonelets files/folders to your Neocities site (drag and drop or use the upload button). *NOTE:* Neocities file uploader has trouble uploading multiple folders at once. Save yourself some confusion and upload each folder individually. It's fine to upload multiple regular files at once.

*NOTE: If you upload a file to Neocities and it has the same name as an existing file in that folder, the old file will be overwritten!* So the [Neocities default index.html](https://thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/default_website.html) will automatically be overwritten by the Zonelets index.html, which in this case is what we want!

![](https://zonelets.net/images/tut_startersite.PNG)

*Caption: After uploading the files, your site should look like this (readme.txt and whatsnew.txt are not necessary to upload)*

### **Writing your first post**

**Writing your first post**

Zonelets posts are written in HTML. If you haven't done much coding before, it may appear visually overwhelming at first. *But for now you can safely ignore virtually ALL the weird-looking stuff*. That said, at some point, you should read a beginner's guide to HTML---Neocities has one that's a [cute cat comic!](https://neocities.org/tutorial/html/1)

1.  Back on the dashboard, navigate to the *posts* folder.
2.  Create a new file following the naming conventions of the example posts. For example: *2020-11-12-Plover-Appreciation.html*

![](https://zonelets.net/images/tut_newpost.PNG)

*Caption: creating and naming a new post*

1.  Copy the contents of *2020-11-10-Post-Template.html* into your new file
2.  Open your post and write some stuff in the *<p>* tag on line 17. For example:

<p>Plovers are adorable, round little birds with tiny stick legs. Some plovers are called dotterel. I think we can all learn a lot from the humble plover, such as: how to be cute.</p>

1.  Save your file by clicking the red Save button in the top right, or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S or Cmd+S.

*Caption: this is how your first post should be looking*

### **Updating the script**

**Updating the script**

1.  Copy the name of your file you just edited, including the *posts/* part. This should look something like *posts/2020-11-12-Plover-Appreciation.html*. You can copy this from the top left corner of the HTML editor, or by going back out to the posts folder and clicking rename (cancel after you copy the filepath, you don't actually want to rename it!).
2.  Now head to the scripts folder and open *scripts.js*.
3.  Paste the filename that you just copied into postsArray (line 23), following the format of the example posts. Now your post will appear in your Archive and the list of recent posts!
4.  Before you go, update the values for *blogName*, *authorName*, and *authorLink* in Section 1: Basic Info.
5.  Save your work and return to the Dashboard. You did it!

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45321972/188299921-6dc8ef89-796e-475e-9053-79ecfd3fb703.png)

*Caption: This is how script.js should look after you add your first post to the posts array and update the "Basic Info" section*

### **Gazing upon your handiwork**

**Gazing upon your handiwork**

1.  Click on the big red link on your dashboard to preview your site! You can also just type "yourusername.neocities.org" into your web browser (replacing "yourusername" with your actual neocities username, of course!).
2.  You should now see a sample homepage with a list of recent posts at the bottom. The post you just made should be at the top!
3.  At the very bottom of the page, you should see a footer saying that *[Your blog's name] is written by [you]*, and if you click on your name it should go to your website/social media link. Remember, you just entered all those values in the script, so you can go back and change them at any time.
4.  If you click on the link to your post in the Recent Posts section, you should see the sample text that you just wrote (were you also writing about plovers? Or was that just me?).

*Caption: This is how your post should look when you view it live!*

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* In web development, sometimes the effects of the changes you make may be delayed. Try refreshing the page, using a "[hard refresh](https://www.howtogeek.com/672607/how-to-hard-refresh-your-web-browser-to-bypass-your-cache/)", or simply coming back to it in a few minutes. Checking in on another device or browser can also help. If things aren't changing, it doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong!

Congratulations! You now have a blog!
